<h1>Fullscreen Map for Garmin Connect</h1>

<p>
    This will add the missing feature to view the map in fullscreen on Garmin Connect activity pages.
    There are two alternative ways to use this, as a bookmarklet that can be selected each time you want to add a fullscreen button or as a
    user script that will run automatically every time you visit an activity page.
</p>

<h2>Bookmarklet</h2>

    <h3>How to create the bookmarklet:</h3>

        <p>
            Drag this link to your bookmark toolbar:
            <a class="code" href="javascript:void(jQuery.getScript('https://git.beroni.us/fullscreen-maps/garmin-connect.js'))">Garmin Connect Fullscreen Map bookmarklet</a>
        </p>

        <p>Alternatively copy the link location or select and copy this code and create a bookmark in your browser using the text as the address for the bookmark.</p>

        <code>javascript:void(jQuery.getScript('https://git.beroni.us/fullscreen-maps/garmin-connect.js'))</code>

    <h3>How to use the bookmarklet:</h3>

        <p>
            When you are at a Garmin Connect activity page (<a href="https://connect.garmin.com/modern/activity/510662746">example</a>)
            select the bookmarklet from your bookmark menu or bookmark toolbar.
            A button will now be added to the controls on the map.
            Click it to maximize the map to fill the entire screen.
            To close the full screen map just press the escape key.
        </p>

<h2>User Script</h2>

    <a class="code" href="https://git.beroni.us/fullscreen-maps/garmin-connect.user.js">Install Garmin Connect Fullscreen Map as a user script</a>

    <p>
        The user script will run automatically every time you visit an activity page so there is no need to select a bookmarklet to add the fullscreen button.
        Due to the way page loading is handled on Garmin Connect it might be necessary to open the activity page in a new tab or window.
    </p>

<h2>Bonus: Summarize splits</h2>

    <p>
        As an extra feature, this bookmarklet will add a link to summarize selected splits from the list of splits in the left column on activity pages.
        Click on rows to select or deselect any number of splits, then click the Summarize-link.
    </p>

    <h3>Bookmarklet</h3>

    <p>
        <a class="code" href="javascript:void(jQuery.getScript('https://git.beroni.us/fullscreen-maps/garmin-connect/splits.js'))">Garmin Connect Summarize splits</a>
    </p>

    <code>javascript:void(jQuery.getScript('https://git.beroni.us/fullscreen-maps/garmin-connect/splits.js'))</code>

    <h3>User Script</h3>

    <p>
        <a class="code" href="https://git.beroni.us/fullscreen-maps/garmin-connect/splits.user.js">Install Garmin Connect Summarize Splits as a user script</a>
    </p>
